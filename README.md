# coding-challenge

* **Objective**: Build a securely hosted Weather app with at least 5 day forecast.


* **Rule #1**: Don't copy code from the various code repos, its important the code is as unique as can be and that will be verified. Figure it out for yourself.


* **Rule #2**: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

* **User Stories**:
 * I can see the weather in my current location.
 * I should have at least a 5 day forecast.
 * I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. heavy to light rain drops, hot sun, wind chill, cloudy sky etc) depending on the weather.
 * I can push a button to toggle between forecast days.

* **Note**: Many internet browsers now require an HTTP Secure (https://) connection to obtain a user's locale via HTML5 Geolocation. For this reason, we recommend using HTML5 Geolocation to get user location and then use the Agro Monitoring Weather API https://agromonitoring.com/api/get which uses an HTTP Secure connection for the weather. But feel free to explore other free weather service APIs that you feel may better suite your web app. You can also securely host your web app for free using firebase hosting firebase.google.com, but you are free to use any hosting service of your choice.

* If you have any questions through out the process please feel free to ask.
